# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model

Introduced a prediction model which can predict if a customer of a bank will churn or not. I have used machine learning as well as deep learning in this project. For this, I have built several machine learning models like logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and KNN. I have also built a deep learning hyperparameter tuning model. I used the random forest model in the deployment of the project. Finally, I used flask to deploy this project.
